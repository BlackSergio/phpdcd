phpdcd
======

**phpdcd** is a Dead Code Detector (DCD) for PHP code.

The goal of **phpdcd** is not not to replace more sophisticated tools such as [phpcs](http://pear.php.net/PHP_CodeSniffer), [pdepend](http://pdepend.org/), or [phpmd](http://phpmd.org/), but rather to provide an alternative to them when you just need to get a quick overview of unused code in a project.

Installation
------------

phpdcd should be installed using the [PEAR Installer](http://pear.php.net/). This installer is the backbone of PEAR, which provides a distribution system for PHP packages, and is shipped with every release of PHP since version 4.3.0.

The PEAR channel (`pear.phpunit.de`) that is used to distribute phpdcd needs to be registered with the local PEAR environment:

    sb@ubuntu ~ % pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
    Adding Channel "pear.phpunit.de" succeeded
    Discovery of channel "pear.phpunit.de" succeeded

This has to be done only once. Now the PEAR Installer can be used to install packages from the PHPUnit channel:

    sb@ubuntu ~ % pear install phpunit/phpdcd

After the installation you can find the phpdcd source files inside your local PEAR directory; the path is usually `/usr/lib/php/PHPDCD`.
